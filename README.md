Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) is a design pattern used to create a structure for implementing behavior that can change over time. It is a way of organizing and managing complex behavior, particularly in real-time systems where the behavior may change in response to external stimuli or events.

This project implemented a simple HFSM library for complex states management.
